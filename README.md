#### A simple multi-page login-based website, May 1, 2025  
#### By **Paul**

## Description  
This application allows users to log in using their first name, last name, and email. After logging in, users are redirected to a home page where they can explore other sections of the website including **About Us**, **Services**, **Contact Us** (which includes a form for submitting contact information), and a **Log Out** page.  
The project showcases fundamental front-end development skills and serves as a basic template for a user-based multi-page site.

## Setup/Installation Requirements  
* Clone the repository from GitHub  
* Navigate into the project directory  
* Open `index.html` in your preferred browser  
* No server or backend is required for this version

## Known Bugs
